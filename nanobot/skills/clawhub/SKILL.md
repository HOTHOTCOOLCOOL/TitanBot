# ClawHub

Public skill registry for AI agents. Search by natural language (vector search).

## Search

```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest search "web scraping" --limit 5
```

## Install

```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest install <slug> --workdir ~/.nanobot/workspace
```

Replace `<slug>` with the skill name from search results. This places the skill into `~/.nanobot/workspace/skills/`, where nanobot loads workspace skills from. Always include `--workdir`.

## Update

```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest update --all --workdir ~/.nanobot/workspace
```

## List installed

```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest list --workdir ~/.nanobot/workspace
```

## Notes

- Requires Node.js (`npx` comes with it).
- No API key needed for search and install.
- Login (`npx --yes clawhub@latest login`) is only required for publishing.
- `--workdir ~/.nanobot/workspace` is critical — without it, skills install to the current directory instead of the nanobot workspace.
- After install, remind the user to start a new session to load the skill.
